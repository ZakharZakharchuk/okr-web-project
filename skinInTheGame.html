<p>In his most provocative and practical book yet,one of the foremost thinkers of
  our
  time
  redefines what it means to understand the world, succeed in a profession,
  contribute
  to
  a
  fair and just society, detect nonsense, and influence others. Citing examples
  ranging
  from
  Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Nicholas Taleb
  shows
  how
  the
  willingness to accept one’s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes,
  saints,
  and
  flourishing people in all walks of life.</p>
<p>The phrase “skin in the game” is one we have often heard but rarely stopped to
  truly
  dissect.
  It is the backbone of risk management, but it’s also an astonishingly rich
  worldview
  that,
  as Taleb shows in this book, applies to all aspects of our lives. As Taleb says,
  “The
  symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule that’s necessary for fairness and
  justice,
  and
  the ultimate BS-buster,” and “Never trust anyone who doesn’t have skin in the
  game.
  Without
  it, fools and crooks will benefit, and their mistakes will never come back to
  haunt
  them.”</p>
