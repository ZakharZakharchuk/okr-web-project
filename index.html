        <p>The <span class="blackSwan">Black Swan</span> is a standalone book in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s landmark Incerto series,
          an
          investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and
          decision-making
          in a world we don’t understand. The other books in the series are Fooled by Randomness,
          Antifragile, Skin in the Game, and The Bed of Procrustes.</p>
        <p>A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is
          unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation
          that
          makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of
          Google
          was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost
          everything
          about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.</p>

        <p>Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the bestselling author of The Black Swan and one of the
          foremost
          thinkers of our time, reveals how to thrive in an uncertain world.
          Just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension, and
          rumors or
          riots
          intensify when someone tries to repress them, many things in life benefit from
          stress,
          disorder, volatility, and turmoil. What Taleb has identified and calls
          “antifragile”
          is
          that
          category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive
          and
          flourish. </p>

        <img class="images" src="image/skin-in-the-game.jpg" alt="Skin in the game">
        <p id="firstParagraph">In his most provocative and practical book yet,one of the foremost thinkers of
          our
          time
          redefines what it means to understand the world, succeed in a profession,
          contribute
          to
          a
          fair and just society, detect nonsense, and influence others. Citing examples
          ranging
          from
          Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Nicholas Taleb
          shows
          how
          the
          willingness to accept one’s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes,
          saints,
          and
          flourishing people in all walks of life.</p>
        <p>The phrase “skin in the game” is one we have often heard but rarely stopped to
          truly
          dissect.
          It is the backbone of risk management, but it’s also an astonishingly rich
          worldview
          that,
          as Taleb shows in this book, applies to all aspects of our lives. As Taleb says,
          “The
          symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule that’s necessary for fairness and
          justice,
          and
          the ultimate BS-buster,” and “Never trust anyone who doesn’t have skin in the
          game.
          Without
          it, fools and crooks will benefit, and their mistakes will never come back to
          haunt
          them.”</p>
