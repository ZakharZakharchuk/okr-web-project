<p>The Black Swan is a standalone book in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s landmark Incerto series, an
  investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision-making
  in a world we don’t understand. The other books in the series are Fooled by Randomness,
  Antifragile, Skin in the Game, and The Bed of Procrustes.</p>
<p>A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is
  unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that
  makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google
  was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything
  about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.</p>
