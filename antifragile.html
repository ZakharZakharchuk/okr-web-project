<p>Antifragile is a standalone book in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s landmark Incerto
  series, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and
  decision-making in a world we don’t understand. The other books in the series
  are Fooled by Randomness, The Black Swan, Skin in the Game, and The Bed of Procrustes.</p>
<p>Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the bestselling author of The Black Swan and one of the
  foremost thinkers of our time, reveals how to thrive in an uncertain world.
  Just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension, and
  rumors or riots intensify when someone tries to repress them, many things in life benefit from
  stress, disorder, volatility, and turmoil. What Taleb has identified and calls
  “antifragile” is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive
  and
  flourish. </p>
